                    <h3>Major Shaitan Singh</h3>
                    <p>Major Shaitan Singh Bhati, PVC (1 December 1924 – 18 November 1962) was an Indian Army officer
                        and recipient of the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration. Singh was born in
                        Rajasthan. On completing his graduation, Singh joined the Jodhpur State Forces. He was
                        transferred to the Kumaon Regiment after the princely state of Jodhpur was merged into India. He
                        took part in operations in the Naga Hills and also in the 1961 Indian annexation of Goa.
                        <br>
                        During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, 13th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment was stationed in the Chushul
                        sector. C Company, under the command of Singh, was holding a position at Rezang La. In the
                        morning hours of 18 November 1962, the Chinese attacked. After several unsuccessful attacks from
                        the front, the Chinese attacked from the rear. The Indians fought until their last rounds,
                        before eventually being overpowered by the Chinese. During the battle, Singh continuously moved
                        from post to post reorganizing the defences and boosting the morale of his men. As he moved
                        between the posts without any cover, he was seriously wounded, and later succumbed to his
                        injuries. For his actions on 18 November 1962, Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
                        <br>Shaitan Singh was born on 1 December 1924 in a Rajput family of Bhati clan in Banasar
                        village, Jodhpur district, Rajasthan.[1] His father was Lieutenant Colonel Hem Singh. Lt. Col.
                        Singh served in France with the Indian Army during World War I, and was awarded the Order of the
                        British Empire (OBE) by the British government.
                        <br>
                        Singh studied in the Chopasni Senior Secondary School, Jodhpur up to his matriculation. At
                        school, he was known for his skills as a football player. After completing his schooling in
                        1943, Singh went to Jaswant College, and completed his graduation in 1947. On 1 August 1949, he
                        joined the Jodhpur State Forces as an officer.
