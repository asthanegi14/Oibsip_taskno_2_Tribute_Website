                    <h3>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h3>
                    <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (February 19, 1627 - April 3, 1680) is a principle of effulgence,
                        rather a divine inspiration.
                        <br> He is certainly not human, he is God. Shivaji Maharaj is a Primal
                        God who took birth in a divine and pure culture. In history, no other religion has produced such
                        an immaculate personality. One has yet to see a monarch who despite being powerful did not use
                        his powers to torment, who despite being glorified was not arrogant, who conquered valorous
                        enemies and who despite being a human functioned as a God.
                        <br> Shivaji Bhonsale I also referred to
                        as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
                        Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur
                        which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati
                        of his realm at Raigad Fort.
                        <br>
                        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal
                        Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
                        Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building
                        forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule
                        with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political
                        traditions, court conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages,
                        replacing Persian in court and administration.
                        <br>
                        Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he
                        began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, as
                        many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
